    description1: "As someone who often finds themself tangled in an endless array of personal projects, I often feel as if new ideas and goals are practically dripping from my ears at times. I've found that as I scribble items off of my to-do list an equal amount seem to simultaneously appear at the bottom. Being a programmer, a visual artist, a film photographer, a musician, and an avid fan of travel, I usually have at least one more thing or idea 'coming down the pipe'. I've spent many years of my life in a chonic state of 'damage control' as the frenzy that is young-adulthood seems to teem around me. How does one create work/life balance if the two seem to be always bleeding over each other? How can I categorize a time to work against a time for creative flow? Both are equally significant, and one without the other disrupts the delicate balance that is 'contentness' that sits perched in the forefront of our brains. The answer? Admittedly, I don't know.",
    description2: "I'm two weeks away from my anticipated graduation from a ten-month coding bootcamp now, and as I look back at all the projects I've done, I see among them the dead and forgotten never-to-be's of the seemingly brilliant ideas my peers and I once had. After taking a second to mourn the losses of all our discarded apps, I begun to see parallels between a job I had spent the first couple decades of my life detesting, and something that I hold very dear to my heart: the creative process. The last year of life has been wildly formative for me. I now understand why the coined word for my program is 'bootcamp'. The first day of class, I remember sitting down and preparing to learn a couple new things about web development over the coming months. Instead what I received was an entire warzone of information overload. I quickly realized that programming wasn't for the faint of heart, and seriously reconsidered my decision for months after. With new information every two weeks paired with alternating personal code reviews, I genuinely didn't think I would make it past month numero uno. I networked with a few coding bootcamp graduates to see how on earth they managed. The resounding response was, as Johnny Cash so well put it, 'one piece at a time'. Abiding by this advice, I decided I was going to do just that. I was just going to try one day at a time. Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. Soon enough, I caught myself audibly laughing at some of the code I had proudly written just months earlier. It was at that point that my instructor informed me 'you did it!'. I wasn't entirely sure what she meant until she explained:",
    quote: `'Learning how to program doesn't mean learning how to write code. It means learning how to learn.'`,
    description3: "Her statement stuck with me then, and continues to. The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. It's impossible for even the best Senior Software Engineer to know everything there is to know about every language, every solution to manipulating linked lists, or how on earth one goes about solving the Pancake Sorting problem. One could spend an entire lifetime doing nothing but eating, sleeping, and breathing code (believe me, I know what that's like) and still wake up the next morning with new things to learn. Some may find that defeating, I find it exciting. I've spent so long with my head in the clouds, constantly anticipating crossing the next project off my to-do list while it recursively increases in length. I thought that reaching the end of that list would mean contentness. Because 'crossing that last item off is going to be so great!'. However, isn't life about simply being here while we have it? About the process of learning and failing over and over again until we get it right? Chasing the end of a scrap of paper seems like a dreary way to exist. I've learned even moreso over the last year that I am capable of anything I put my mind to, and you are too. I find excitement in refactoring; In adding an entirely new to-do list to the end of the first. There's so much to learn, and so much to create.",
